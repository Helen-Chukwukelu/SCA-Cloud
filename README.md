# SCA-Cloud-School-Application

I installed Docker.

Created a docker hub account.

I installed httpd web server, configured it, I used simple html code for the website and added the content required.

I created a dockerfile and used that to build my image.

I ran the container and tested my application...running well.

I created a branch called Start and feature.

I committed my dockerfile in the docker folder.

updated the content of my web page to read "Welcome to SCA  Cloud School Application, this is my first assessment".

I Commited my changes and merged branch in git.

I pushed my final docker image to dockerhub... linked is https://hub.docker.com/u/helenbliss
